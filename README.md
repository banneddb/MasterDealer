## 🛠️ Problems & Solutions
We faced multiple challenges while building this bot, from debugging unresponsive commands to figuring out hosting solutions.  

- **Original Idea:**  
  We wanted to create a Canvas-integrated bot for grades/announcements. This proved too complex for an intro course, so we pivoted to a blackjack game.  
- **Hosting Challenge:**  
  Instead of manually running the bot every time, we deployed it to **Heroku**, enabling 24/7 uptime and more efficient testing.
