## Overview
Ever wanted to practice with blackjack but didn't know where to start? This project aimed to entertain Discord users by having them play against a dealer through any channel in the comfort of their own server.

## Installation
Add to your server: 
- https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1308509219556687872&permissions=67584&integration_type=0&scope=bot

# Problems and Solutions
We faced a multitude of problems ranging from the bot not responding to figuring out how to host the bot. The original idea was to have a canvas-integrated bot where we could post announcements and our grades into discord without having to log in. However, we realized that this idea was far-fetched for an intro to CS class so we decided to stick with something more simpler.
How did we solve our issues?
- We hosted the bot on Heroku so that we didn't have to run it every time to test it, making our test sessions much more efficient!
- We made it so that the bot would respond with specific prompts to specific user inputs so that it can identify when a person wants to hit, stay or just start a game.
- Overall, we learned a lot about how hosting of discord bots work and how in the future we can integrate more advanced technologies with our discord bot and add more features (fake discord money to gamble with, more then 1 player, etc)
