Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, we have set up the bot to run 24/7 and is currently running active in our server. It is also able to respond to simple user inputs, such as 'hello' and 'goodbye'.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still need to integrate a dictionary into the bot and have it be able to read and print out the defenition/pronounciation.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We had trouble setting up the bot in the first place because it was not responding, but after using our program in PyCharm it started running fine.
