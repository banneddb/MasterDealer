# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

scholarBot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord bot that you can add to your own personal server that updates you with upcoming deadlines and grade changes within Canvas.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will be able to let you login to your Canvas account through a secure login link (one which uses tokens and what not) and will protect your privacy. From there, anytime a new assignment is posted, you can customize the bot on when and where (within inthe discord channels) you would like to be notified of the assignments. Grade changes will also be incorporated, and you can see what happens if you get a 0 in an assingment and how it changes your overall grade and vise versa. You (might) be also able to upload files of your homeowork in which your bot will then submit that file for you within canvas for a specific assignment. Obviously, you will have to run the command and specify which assignment you want to upload the file for. The bot can also handle anouncements from professors in which you can reply to them.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A, but will most likely put this on my resume if it turns out well.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be where the bot can just post grade changes and new assignments via Canvas. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be where anouncements from professors will be posted and you can also test your grade out by seeing what happens when an assignment recieves a 0.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would involve the above features, plus FILE UPLOAD. File upload is a feature that we really want to get done.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I just set up a discord and invited my classmate to join it. This is the discord where we will be testing out the features and researching what the bot can do. Topics that need to be researched are how we can integrate an API, specifully canvas in this case, with that of discord. I also might look into different libraries and frameworks within python that can make the integration easier on us, and also find out a way to store user information through tokens. We will most likely be working on the bot together, but I think I will focus on the file upload and anouncements while my classmate focuses on getting the bot up and running and handling issues with tokens and Canvas API.
